# Sword of the Exiled

The humans have built an outpost on the planet Mars. A city of opulence and wonder develops, but it is plagued by a rash of alien immigrants from Venus. The humans erected a wall and defenses to keep out the illegal aliens. Co-operative sci-fi puzzler. Play as an illegal alien and sneak past the guards into the paradise that lies behind the walls.
